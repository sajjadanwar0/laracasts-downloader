# Laracasts Downloader

A robust Go application that downloads Laracasts topics, series and bits. This tool helps you organize and manage your Laracasts content offline for convenient access and learning.

#### Note: This project is still in beta mode, not fully implemented yet it downloads all topics, series and bits from Laracasts.

## Features

### Topic-Based Organization
- Automatically organizes downloads by topics (e.g., Laravel, Vue, Testing, etc.)
- Creates a clean directory structure for easy navigation
- Generates summary files for each topic and an overall download summary
- Maintains metadata for all downloaded content

### Concurrent Downloads
- Uses worker pools for efficient parallel downloading
- Handles multiple topics and series simultaneously
- Implements rate limiting to prevent server overload
- Optimizes bandwidth usage with configurable concurrency

### Smart Error Handling
- Retries failed downloads with exponential backoff
- Maintains download state to resume interrupted operations
- Creates detailed logs of successes and failures
- Validates downloaded files for integrity

### Progress Tracking
- Shows real-time download progress with ETA
- Provides detailed statistics for each topic and series
- Creates summary files with download status and metadata
- Displays bandwidth usage and download speeds

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Go 1.18 or higher installed:
```bash
go version
```

2. Install ffmpeg (required for video processing):
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows
choco install ffmpeg
```

3. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sajjadanwar0/laracasts-downloader.git
cd laracasts-downloader
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod download
```

## Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure your environment variables in .env:
```
EMAIL=your@email.com
PASSWORD=your_password
DOWNLOAD_PATH=/path/to/downloads

```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Navigate to the `cmd/laracasts-dl` folder using 
`cd cmd/laracasts-dl`

2. Run the downloader to fetch all available content:
```bash
go run main.go
```

The application will:
1. Log in to your Laracasts account
2. Fetch all available topics
3. Create topic directories
4. Download all series for each topic
5. Generate summary files

### Download Specific Series

To download a specific series, use the series flag with the slug:
```bash
go run main.go -s the-definition-series
```

### Download All Topics

To download all topics:
```bash
go run main.go
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| EMAIL | Laracasts account email | Yes | - |
| PASSWORD | Laracasts account password | Yes | - |
| DOWNLOAD_PATH | Download directory path | Yes | - |

## Performance Optimization

The downloader implements several performance optimization strategies:

### Buffered Downloads
- Uses buffered I/O for efficient file operations
- Implements configurable buffer sizes
- Minimizes system calls during downloads

### Concurrent Processing
- Parallel processing of topics and series
- Worker pools for download management
- Rate limiting to prevent overload

### Memory Management
- Efficient memory usage with buffer pools
- Garbage collection optimization
- Memory-conscious file handling

### State Management
- Persistent download state
- Resume capability for interrupted downloads
- Efficient metadata caching

## Error Handling

The application implements comprehensive error handling:

- **Download Retry**: Automatically retries failed downloads with exponential backoff
- **State Recovery**: Maintains download state for recovery after interruptions
- **Validation**: Checks file integrity after download
- **Logging**: Creates detailed logs for debugging and troubleshooting
- **Error Classification**: Categorizes errors for appropriate handling:
  - Network errors
  - Authentication failures
  - File system errors
  - Rate limiting issues
